# TypeOrBurst
"The Last Bubble - Type or Burst" is a 2D topdown typing game.
Gameplay:
  - Type words to protect the bubble from bursting by enemy collision!
  - The less typing errors, the higher your multiplier, the higher your final score!
.
The game was created as a project for my "games practice" module of my game development course. 
.
Total development time was about 4 weeks fulltime. (Resumed development in July 2022)
.
Game features:
  - four different enemy types (normal, tank, fast, shadow)
    - tank: 2 assigned words instead of one
    - shadow: has a dissolve shader, which makes it go invisible
    - randomly assigned color-materials
    - particle effects for trails and explosions
  - Highscore list
  - Custom word list (to be displayed ingame)
  - Beatbox sound effects (recorded by myself)
.
I am planning on publishing the game after my game development course on Steam. 
.
Impressions and feedback are very welcome!
